1.OVERVIEW
I will be working on a particle effect that will look like stars that are slowly floating around. These stars will render lines to 
eachother when in certain proximity of eachother. These paricles will be shown on top of some sort of outerspace textured background 
to add to its overall effect. As a stretch goal I might make it interactive such as being able to manipulate particles with mouse.

2.SCHEDULE
  
  wk1: Collect info on creating particles.
  
  wk2: Get some code done for testing.
  
  wk3: Have movement done.
  
  wk4: Make particles interact with eachother by rendering lines.
  
  wk5: [Stretch goal] Make interactive somehow.
  
3.IMPLEMENTATION

  I will create a web-based application using particles.js.
